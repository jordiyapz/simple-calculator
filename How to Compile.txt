First, you will need to make sure that you have set the correct path for your gcc / gnu compiler 
so that it can run directly from cmd.
Next, just run the "BatchCompiler.bat" file, and it should compile.

Or, you can just start the "main.exe" program that I've compiled

*ps: This program was originaly written by me about half year ago where I learned to write C++ code
by myself. At that day, I have never used any C++ IDE (such as Codeblock, DevC++, etc).
I compiled all my code by running a cmd to run the compiler. After that, I tried to write a simple
batch program to automate all compile task. And it always works as I expected, unlike codeblock's
compiler. I've tried using codeblock for this program, but there are a lot of issue that I can't handle.
